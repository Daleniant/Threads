2 1~Integrals are a type of calculus that is used to calculate the area under a curve. They are used to measure the rate of change of a function over a certain interval. In other words, they can be used to find the area of a shape when given the equation of the shape. To calculate an integral, you use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus which states that the integral of a function is equal to the area under its graph. This means that you can use integrals to calculate the area of any shape when given its equation. It is also used to calculate the volume of a solid when given its equation. Integrals can be used to solve many problems in physics, engineering, and other fields. Hope this helps!~davinciGPT3~0~
